SkyFetch is a simple and user-friendly online tool for obtaining high-resolution download links for images from the BlueSky social platform.

Users can quickly get direct download links for high-resolution images by simply pasting the original image link. All data processing is done locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and security.

The code for this project was primarily written by `claude-3.5-sonnet` and `chatgpt-4o-latest`, with numerous style and functionality design suggestions and feedback provided by me.
